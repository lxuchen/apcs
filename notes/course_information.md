Company Rules for Programming Assignments

This is very similar to a company having rules that employees are expected to follow.  In the computer science classroom, if a student fails to follow the Company Rules having to do with programming assignments, there is a grade deduction. 

Some of our company rules appear below. 

1. Begin/end braces -- { } -- are each on a separate line. or the opening brace is on the header line

2. Indentation is important. 
- Indent with Replit tab function. 
- Indent all statements in a block in the same manner
- Indent body of if-else statements. 
- Indent body of loops. 

3. Variable names begin with lowercase letters. If the variable name is two or more words, capitalize the first letter of the second, third, etc.,words. 

4. A class name should be a noun and should begin with a capital letter. 

5. Method names are verbs and the names follow the same rules that variable names follow. 

6. Follow the Sample Lab formatting document on Schoology
